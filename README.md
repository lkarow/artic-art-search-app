# Art Search App

An app built with React that allows users to browse the [Art Institute of Chicago artwork collection](https://www.artic.edu/). The app fetches data from the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) and displays the artwork.

Pagination is provided for the gallery and search results. The data loaded for each page is limited to the data displayed.

Code linting (eslint) and prettier are also configured. And basic user testing is included.
